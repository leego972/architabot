# Cyber Security Modules — Grand Bazaar Pricing Strategy

## Credit Economics
- Free tier: 300 credits/month ($0)
- Pro tier: 5,000 credits/month ($29/mo) → $0.0058/credit
- Enterprise tier: 25,000 credits/month ($99/mo) → $0.00396/credit
- Top-up: 5,000 credits = $29.99 → $0.006/credit

## Pricing Philosophy
Modules should be priced so that:
1. **Buying is cheaper than building** — If Titan would take 30+ credits of chat + sandbox time to build equivalent functionality, the module should cost less
2. **Impulse-buy range** — Most modules 150-800 credits (under $5 equivalent)
3. **Premium tools** — Complex agents/frameworks 1,000-5,000 credits ($6-$30 equivalent)
4. **Enterprise tools** — Full suites 5,000-15,000 credits ($30-$90 equivalent)

## Build-vs-Buy Analysis
- Simple script (port scanner): ~50 credits of chat to build → price at 200-400 credits (4-8x, worth it for time saved)
- Medium tool (OSINT framework): ~200 credits of chat to build → price at 600-1,200 credits (3-6x, worth it for quality)
- Complex agent (autonomous scanner): ~500+ credits of chat + debugging → price at 1,500-3,000 credits (3-6x, worth it for reliability)
- Full framework (exploit kit): ~1,000+ credits + expertise → price at 3,000-8,000 credits (3-8x, worth it for expertise)
